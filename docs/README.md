# CS 301 Project Overview

Author's note: This report, as well as the accompanying code, was written individually.

### Code
All three of the below links are different representations of the same code. The first and second link offer different ways to view the same file that contains both the source code and the output produced during and after execution. The third file offers just the source code for the project in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.<br>

[Sourcecode only as Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/joshuakobuskie/CS301_Individual/blob/b53f78746497763da6eacb4790f323fe66701910/docs/source_code_only.ipynb)<br>

### Replicating Results
To replicate my results or experiment with the code, simply download the source code document listed here:<br>[Sourcecode only as Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/joshuakobuskie/CS301_Individual/blob/b53f78746497763da6eacb4790f323fe66701910/docs/source_code_only.ipynb)<br>It is strongly recommended that the code be opened and run in a Kaggle environment, but other environments that support python, including Google Colab, may work. No gurantees are issued about these alternative platforms, as the code has been designed and tested primarily in the Kaggle environment.
